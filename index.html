                    This BMI calculator is intended for adult uses only. The
                    results can be off for people aging from 2 to 20 years old.

            <h2>What is body mass index?</h2>

            <p>
                Body mass index or BMI is a measure to see weather someone has
                the right weight for their height. It is calculated by dividing
                your body mass by your height squared.
                <br />
                BMI can, but is not intended for finding out whether a person is
                fat or thin, as BMI does not say how many fat does someone have.
                BMI mainly says how much muscle or bone is in one's body. This
                may cause athletes to have higher BMI while still being very
                healthy. Even so, BMI is still very popular in giving
                information on weather somebody is healthy or not.
